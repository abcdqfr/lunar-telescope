# Lunar Telescope deterministic pre-push hook
#
# This prevents public CI spam by running local preflight checks before push.
# It performs no network fetches and respects the hybrid contract:
# - baseline must always pass
# - optional tools are best-effort
#
# Enable with:
#   git config core.hooksPath .githooks
#
# To bypass for an emergency:
#   git push --no-verify
